## Problem 2.11

### Problem 2.11(a)

```{r Problem 2.11(a)}
rm(list=ls())
f<-function (y,x){density<-NULL
for (i in 1:length(x))
density<-c(density,prod(dcauchy(y,x[i],1)))
density}
N<-f(c(43,44,45,46.5,47.5),seq(0,1,0.01))/(0.01*sum(f(c(43,44,45,46.5,47.5),seq(0,1,0.01))))
plot(seq(0,1,0.01),N,type="l",ylim=c(0,1.2),main="Problem 2.11(a) - Normalized Posterior Density Function")
```

### Problems 2.11(b-c)

```{r Problem 2.11(b-c)}
set.seed(76)
Draws<-sample(seq(0,1,0.01),1000,0.01*N,replace=TRUE)
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
hist(Draws,breaks=100,main="Problem 2.11(b) - Sample (n=1000) from Posterior Density")
hist(rcauchy(length(Draws),Draws),breaks=100,main="Problem 2.11(c) - Sample (n=1000) from Predictive Distribution")
